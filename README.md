The project involves multiple linear regression analysis of of the prices of varying car brands based on features such as engine volume, body, mileage,  engine type, registration and year. 
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of a multiple linear regression model. 
The notebook demonstrates how to handle multiple independent variables, interpret regression coefficients, evaluate model performance, and address issues like multicollinearity. 
It provides a step-by-step guide to building and assessing a regression model using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
